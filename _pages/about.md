I am a software developer @[NAVER](https://www.navercorp.com/).

My responsibilities include developing backend web APIs and maintaining server for [Papago](https://papago.naver.com/). I have recently moved to Papago's MLOps team, focusing mainly on serving ML models and building consistent pipelines for backend operations. I am currently interested in writing concise and clear codes for expandable system using k8s.

Before joining NAVER, I worked at [TmaxOS](https://tmaxos.com) as a C++ developer, working on a desktop office application called ToOffice.

I obtained my masters in Information Systems at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr), and my bachelors in Mathematics and Economics at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca).
